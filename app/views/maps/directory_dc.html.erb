<h1>Mapping Early Washington, D.C., Law & Family: 1822</h1>

<div class="introduction">
  <p>The 1822 city directory for Washington, D.C., is an incredibly rich resource, but one that presents a unique set of problems. First, the directory does not come close to providing information on all of the city’s inhabitants. It lists the residences and business locations for about 1,600 individuals, while noting – per the 1820 Census – that over 13,000 people lived in Washington, D.C. Only a little over 10% of the population is included in the directory, and as a result, this map. It does not even take into account the 19,000 additional people living in Alexandria, Georgetown, and Washington and Alexandria Counties who were also not included in the scope of the directory.</p>

  <p>Why is this picture so incomplete? The answer seems to be that the directory itself reflects the structures of the world in which it was written. The public sphere of Washington, D.C., buttressed by gendered and racial hierarchies, was dominated by white men, and it is these white men who appear overwhelmingly in the directory’s pages. White women, who made up 4,820 of the city’s inhabitants, do not appear in the directory unless they were widows, operated their own businesses, or otherwise served as heads of household. Free black individuals also appear in the directory, although not at the number of 1,696 as reported in the census. The city’s 1,945 enslaved inhabitants are also absent from the directory, unless they lived independently and somehow managed to be mistaken for free blacks. Children of any race do not appear in the directory, nor do transient workers such as sailors.</p>

  <p>Still, this directory remains an incredibly valuable resource for understanding freedom suits. Enslaved petitioners stepped into the public sphere when they made the case for their freedom – the same public sphere dominated by the names peppering the 1822 directory. Those names, although far from providing a complete picture of life in urban Washington, D.C., appear throughout the case papers as jurors, lawyers, witnesses, defendants, and more. About one in every five people listed in the directory has a link to a person page on O Say Can You See, showing some sort of direct connection to the freedom petition process. By mapping out the directory, we hope not only to highlight the spatial relationships and patterns that undergirded legal and personal connections, but also to demonstrate the ubiquity of participation in the freedom suit process and help bring to life an almost 200-year-old snapshot of the nation’s capital.</p>

          <p>This layer calls out the residents of D.C. who appear within the court records on OSCYS in some capacity. Clicking on an individual in the map will display a link to his or her Person Page on OSCYS.</p>

          <p>Some ambiguities arise when trying to reconcile the data from the directory with data from the freedom suits. To provide a fictitious example, imagine that a John Smith appears as a juror in 1822, but five John Smiths are listed in the directory for that year. Without further information, it is almost impossible to know with confidence which John Smith is the one appearing in the court documents. Misspellings, movement in and out of the city, sons named after fathers, and the inconsistent use of initials all add to the confusion.</p>

          <p>This layer also displays all of the individuals, businesses, and public buildings listed in the city directory.</p>

          <p>One problem presented by the 1822 directory is the ambiguity that oftentimes defines its writing. Actual house numbers are not listed, and the directory's creators contented themselves to provide locations such as "10w near Penn Ave," or "corn South Cap St and Ns." What exactly constitutes "near" or which corner of an intersection is meant is left undefined. With this in mind, the locations on the map do come relatively close to the actual locations of the city's historical inhabitants, but complete accuracy cannot be expected. The locations of larger landmarks, such as churches, hotels, and banks were slightly easier to determine, and have been placed on the map as a reference point for those hoping to glean a greater understanding of the urban geography of Washington, D.C., in 1822.</p>

        <p>They were consolidated into eight categories based on HISCO occupational codes. To better reflect the working realities of life in Washington, D.C., the "labor" classification was broken down further into "skilled" and "unskilled."</p>

        <p>Administrative includes managerial jobs such as foreman, magistrate, and various government administrators.</p>

        <p>Agricultural jobs include farmer, gardner, farrier, and other animal husbandry work.</p>

        <p>Clerical is a category that encompasses the various clerks and messengers as well as inspectors and paymasters.</p>

        <p>Professional contains careers such as attorney, doctor, teacher, clergyman, and ships pilots.</p>

        <p>Sales jobs include merchants and shop owners.</p>

        <p>Service work refers to such jobs as barber, tavern keeper, members of the military, and police officers.</p>

        <p>Skilled labor requires a specialization, such as blacksmith, printer, shoemaker, or tailor.</p>

        <p>Unskilled labor is for non-specialized work. These individuals are listed as "laborers" in the directory.</p>

        <p>This map is organized by the racial identifiers given in the directory.</p>

        <p>The Washington, D.C., of 1822 was governed by an oppressive racial hierarchy, and this was reflected in the language of the city directory. Directory-makers made a notation of "col'd (wo)man" next to the residents of African-American descent.</p>

        <p>To reproduce the racial language of the directory is to reproduce the language of oppression and white supremacy, but to use more modern or acceptable language may be misleading, providing an inaccurate image of the world in which freedom petitioners lived and the structures they navigated in the pursuit of their freedom. For this reason, the original language of the directory is preserved in this map.</p>
